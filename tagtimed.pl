# TagTime daemon: this figures out from scratch when to beep and does so, 
#   continuously, even when the previous ping is still unanswered.
# After each ping it also runs launch.pl (with the 'quiet' arg since
#   this is already doing the beeping) which launches popups or an editor
#   for any overdue pings.
# Might be nice to watch ~/.tagtimerc (aka settings.pl) for changes a la 
#   watching.pl so that we don't have to restart this daemon when settings 
#   change. (does it suffice to just re-require it?)

=head1 NAME

tagtimed - Stochastic tagging of your time!

=head1 SYNPOSIS

    $ tagtimed.pl     # Start tagtime

    $ tagtimed.pl -l  # Start tagtime if not already running.

    $ tagtimed.pl -s  # Start tagtime if not already running, be silent otherwise.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

See L<http://messymatters.com/tagtime/>

You can add the following to your C<.bashrc> or equivalent to make sure TagTime starts
when you open a shell:

    tagtimed.pl -l -s &

=head1 BUGS

The C<-l> switch must be used on all processes for locks to work correctly.

The C<-l> switch will exit Tagtime if it's already running with another user using the C<-l>
switch.

__DATA__
This section exists to make it trivial to implement the -l (lock)
feature of tagtimed.
